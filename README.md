# IVI-SHOP

An example store built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) 

## Development

Using an Api server form this repo [https://github.com/dvelezroman/ivi-shop](https://github.com/dvelezroman/ivi-shop)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dvelezroman/ivi-shop
cd React-GraphQL-Ecommerce-webapp
yarn # or npm install
yarn start # or npm start
```

Note: You will want to change the `uri: "http://localhost/graphql",` inside `src/app.js` with your own api url endpoint.
